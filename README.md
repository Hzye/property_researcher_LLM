## Motivation
Recently I have gained interest in the property market. Since I don't have enough time to watch every single video, listen to every podcast and read every article, I wanted to fuse all these sources of information into a localised database and use it as context for queries that I may have.

I'm starting off with just videos first, and then eventually adding other data sources as well as the property metrics database that I pull to monthly.
